# Text-to-SQL LLM Application

## Overview

This project is a scalable Python application that utilizes advanced prompt engineering techniques to convert natural language queries into optimized SQL statements. By leveraging generative AI and natural language processing (NLP), the application enables real-time database interactions and rapid data retrieval, significantly enhancing efficiency and maintainability.

## Technologies Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for developing the application.
- **SQLite**: A lightweight database engine used for data storage and retrieval.
- **Google Gemini Pro**: Integrated to facilitate the translation of user prompts into SQL queries.
- **Generative AI**: Employed for natural language understanding and query generation.

## Features

- **Natural Language Processing**: Converts user input in natural language into SQL queries seamlessly.
- **Optimized SQL Generation**: Ensures that the generated SQL queries are efficient and performant.
- **Real-Time Interactions**: Allows users to interact with the database in real-time, providing quick responses to queries.
- **Scalability**: Designed to handle increasing loads and user requests without compromising performance.
